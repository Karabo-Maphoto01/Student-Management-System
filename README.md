# Student-Management-System

A simple **command-line based Student Management System** built in Java.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and ArrayLists to store and manage student records.

---

## ✨ Features
The system allows you to:
- ➕ Add a new student  
- 📋 Display all student records  
- 🔍 Search for a student by ID  
- ❌ Remove a student by ID  
- ✏️ Update a student’s details (name or age)  
- 🚪 Exit the program  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java 
- **ArrayList** for data storage
- **Scanner** for user input

📖 Learning Outcomes
-Understanding classes and objects in Java
-Implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
-Using ArrayList for dynamic data storage
-Building a menu-driven program using Scanner
-Input validation and basic error handling

🏆 Future Improvements
-Save student records to a file or database
