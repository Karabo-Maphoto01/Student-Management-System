# Student-Management-System

A simple **command-line based Student Management System** built in Java.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and ArrayLists to store and manage student records.

---

##  Features
The system allows you to:
-  Add a new student  
-  Display all student records  
-  Search for a student by ID  
-  Remove a student by ID  
-  Update a student’s details (name or age)  
-  Exit the program  

---

## Technologies Used
-  Java 
-  ArrayList for data storage
-  Scanner for user input

---

##  Project Structure
- Student.java # Defines the Student class
- StudentManager.java # Manages the list of students
- StudentManagementSystem.java # Main menu-driven application
- README.md # Project documentation

# Learning Outcomes
-Understanding classes and objects in Java
-Implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
-Using ArrayList for dynamic data storage
-Building a menu-driven program using Scanner
-Input validation and basic error handling

 Future Improvements
- Save student records to a file or database
- Add GPA or course details
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Add sorting (e.g., by name or age)
